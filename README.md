# 📊 Business Intelligence Project: NYC Crime Analysis

## 🚔 Overview
This project explores crime trends in **New York City (2018-2021)** using **data analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling**. We leverage **SQL, Tableau, and Python** to identify crime hotspots, analyze offender and victim demographics, and assess the impact of criminal justice policies.

## 📂 Data Sources

- **NYPD Arrest Data**: Records of arrests made by the NYPD.
- **NYPD Complaint Data**: Reports of felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes.
